# Introduction #

This script provides a lobby for the hosting of co-op missions in a similar way to _IL-2: 1946_.

## Details ##

The host player creates the server and initially loads and starts the il2coop.mis which contains a number of dummy aircraft. Client players can now connect to the server. Every player that selects an army is placed into a dummy aircraft.

Once in a dummy aircraft the player has access to the mission order menu (TAB + 4). First the host player has to select a mission via this menu. Now the players can select a aircraft from the selected mission via the mission order menu.

The host can then start the mission and all players are moved into their selected aircraft.
